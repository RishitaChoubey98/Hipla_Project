                            <p>f. Security policy</p>
                            <p>Hipla uses commercially reasonable security measures to protect your User Content and your

                            <p>This Agreement is governed by and is to be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
                            Republic of
                            Singapore and in the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this

                            dispute arising in relation to the Contatrack.ai app, the courts of Singapore will have

                            <p>h. Miscellaneous</p>
                            <p>This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Hipla. It supersedes and replaces any
                            and all
                            prior agreements between you and Hipla relating to your use of the Contatrack.ai app. The
                            failure of
                            Hipla to exercise or enforce any right of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of
                            such
                            right. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of
                            this
                            Agreement is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court, that provision is deemed
                            severed
                            from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                            provisions. We can change this Agreement at any time, and your continued use of the
                            Contatrack.ai
                            app after any change we make will mean that you agreed with the changes. Notice to you may
                            be made
                            by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the Contatrack.ai app or
